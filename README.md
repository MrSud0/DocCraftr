# DocCraftr

## Overview

**DocCraftr** is a Python-based utility designed to generate a mix of different file types filled with dummy data. It supports several common formats such as `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.csv`, `.json`, and `.xls`. You can specify the number of files, the root path for the output directory, and the file types to generate. Additionally, it allows spreading the generated files into random subdirectories for better organization.

## Features

- Generate various document types including `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.csv`, `.json`, and `.xls`.
- Control the number of files to generate and the destination folder.
- Specify the mix of file formats to create, or use the default set.
- Optionally spread the generated files into random subdirectories within the root folder.

## Requirements

The tool uses the following libraries, which need to be installed prior to usage:

- `argparse`: Standard Python library for handling command line arguments.
- `fpdf`: For generating `.pdf` files.
  - Install using `pip install fpdf`
- `python-docx`: For generating `.docx` files.
  - Install using `pip install python-docx`
- `xlwt`: For generating `.xls` files.
  - Install using `pip install xlwt`

## Installation

First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install fpdf python-docx xlwt
```

## Usage

The tool can be run from the command line with the following arguments:

```sh
python doc_craftr.py -n <number_of_files> -f <destination_folder> [-m <file_formats>] [-s]
```

### Arguments:

- `-n, --number` (required): Number of files to generate.
- `-f, --folder` (required): Root path of the destination folder where files will be generated.
- `-m, --mix` (optional): Comma-separated list of formats to generate (e.g., `txt,pdf,docx,csv,json,xls`). Defaults to `txt,pdf,docx` if not specified.
- `-s, --spread` (optional): Enable spreading of files into random subdirectories within the root folder.

### Example:

Generate 10 files in the `output` folder, with formats `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.json`, and spread them into subdirectories:

```sh
python doc_craftr.py -n 10 -f output -m txt,pdf,json -s
```

## How It Works

1. **Generate Files**: The script generates a specified number of files using random names from a pool of common corporate-style document titles. Each file is populated with some dummy content to simulate real files.
2. **Spreading Files**: If the `--spread` option is enabled, the generated files will be randomly moved to any existing subdirectories within the specified root folder.

## File Types Supported

- `.txt`: Plain text files.
- `.pdf`: PDF files generated using the `fpdf` library.
- `.docx`: Word documents generated using `python-docx`.
- `.csv`: CSV files containing simple tabular data.
- `.json`: JSON files containing key-value pairs.
- `.xls`: Excel spreadsheet files generated using the `xlwt` library.

## Notes

- The root folder will be created if it doesn't exist.
- The script ensures that generated files have unique names by drawing from a pool of predefined titles.
- Subdirectories must exist in the root folder for the spreading option to work; otherwise, files will remain in the root.

## Roadmap

Here are some upcoming features and improvements planned for the tool:

1. **Allow Input File Names from a File**: Support for reading file names from an external file, giving users more flexibility in providing their own list of file names.
2. **AI-Generated Content**: Integrate OpenAI API to allow the content of each generated file to be generated by AI, providing more varied and intelligent dummy data.
3. **AI-Generated File Names**: Use AI to generate unique and context-relevant file names, making the generated files more realistic and dynamic.
4. **GUI Version**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for users who prefer interacting with the tool visually rather than via the command line.
5. **Custom Templates**: Allow users to define custom templates for each file type, providing more control over the content structure.
6. **Advanced Directory Spreading**: Add more options for controlling how files are spread across subdirectories, such as specifying depth or including filtering rules.
